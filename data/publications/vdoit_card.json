  "publication_abstract": "Video calling or voice calling through the use of the internet is a very common thing in today's world. Nevertheless, users have to pay charges directly or indirectly, tolerating all the delays even if you use the facility within the same network or sub-network. Over 30 million US households used Voice over IP (VoIP) until the end of 2010. Specialist found that 31.4% of the household used VoIP as the main and only home phone line by 2012. Users up till now have multiplied by a huge factor. There are several drawbacks of using video calling over the internet within a small network such as delay of packets (travel to the main server outside network and reenter the same network again), direct or indirect costs, users need to be always connected online and efficiency and speed of the user's system vary according to connection quality and bandwidth. In this project, we implemented a WebRTC enabled web application which provides free peer to peer video calling and conferencing tool for any private organization on top of their existing private network.",
