I got invited by the Personality Advancement Circle of Engineers (PACE), WCE, Sangli to share my interview experience, preparation, and journey. I discussed why problem-solving skills are an essential part of an interview for an engineer. I highlighted how I studied and spent most of my time practicing data structures and algorithms. Participating in several competitive programming contests kept me down to earth and made me aware of my expertise. Basic concepts of computer science are a must to become a sound computer engineer. \n</br>\n</br>\nI thank the PACE club of Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli, to invite me and give me this opportunity.\n</br>\n</br>\n<strong>Watch on Facebook: </strong><a href='https://www.facebook.com/wcepace/videos/1296865000458332/?t=0' target='_blank' rel='no opener noreferer'>Interview Experience Sharing by Mr. Deepak Ahire.</a>\n</div>\n</div>",
